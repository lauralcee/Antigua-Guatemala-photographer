# Antigua Guatemala Photographer
We are a couple from Spain & the USA, living & [Antigua Guatemala photographer](https://manuelaldana.com/) for the past 8 years. In the summers we visit both our families & also cover weddings in Europe & the USA.
We have photographed 200+ weddings, been published in more than 30 blogs & won several international awards. In 2019 we were named 1 of 30 Rising Stars of Wedding Photography by Rangefinder Magazine.
Not only were they an absolute dream to work with, our photographs are breathtaking. They seem to get better the more we look at them, which is an unexpected delight. Each time we go back and look, there's something more beautiful about them and they possess something we didn't see before. It's pretty remarkable! Everyone we've shared them with has been so blown away and has given us - and them - the ultimate compliment: they captured the love we have for each other so effortlessly. We totally agree and are so thrilled with the collection. We not only received a lasting documentation of the best day of our lives, but we earned friends in a beautiful country that no doubt we look forward to seeing again.
